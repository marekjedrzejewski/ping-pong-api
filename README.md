Fast-paced, high-stakes ping pong!
This project tests your reflexes and decision-making by giving you mere 30 seconds to respond to every volley. **Can you handle the heat?**


## Endpoints
- `/` has game state info
- `/ping` lets you swing paddle on one side
- `/pong` lets you swing paddle on the other side

Everything is using `GET` so you can just put it in your browser address.
